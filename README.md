## Program Goals
"Welcome to this module challenge focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library. As a crucial component in various fields, such as data science, machine learning, and business intelligence, practical data analysis involves examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets. This assignment provides a hands-on opportunity to develop these skills.

In this challenge, we'll dive into a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, exploring and analyzing data to address real-world business questions. Your mission will involve identifying top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, and more. By the end of this task, you'll have a practical understanding of data exploration, transformation, and analysis, preparing you for more complex data scenarios in your future career."

## Bugs

This isn't a bug but rather a special note: there was a random .DS_Store file in the challenge files from bootcamp spot which I promptly deleted because it's specific to macOS and Apple is the bane of my existence so I felt obligated to purge that bit of heresy from my holy Windows 10 system.
